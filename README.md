# julamoto
Explicit Kuramoto model implemented in Julia, covering both the simple Kuramoto model and the Kuramoto model with noise (stochastic or finite-temperature) using different solvers.

Bindings to Python will be available, though they will be simple and we recommend writing Julia code directly. Functions for obtaining parameters such as instantaneous frequency and phase difference are available, in addition to functions for internal plotting and data output in a NumPy- and Matplotlib-friendly manner. Examples of setup usign Julia and plotting using Python (my preferred method) are provided.

## About the Kuramoto model

The Kuramoto model is a mathematical model used to describe coupled oscillators and the synchronization thereof. It is governed by the following system of differential equations on the following form:

$$\dot{\theta}_i = F_i + \frac{K}{N}\sum_j^N\text{sin}(\theta_j - \theta_i)$$

where $i$ and $j$ are oscillator indices, $K$ is a coupling term, $N$ is the number of oscillators and $F_i$ is $i$th oscillator natural frequency. I've seen some applications which neglect explicitly mentioning the normalization provided by dividing by N, $K/N$, and instead write the coupling as simply $k$ or similar. In the absence of any interaction ($K=0$), the natural frequency is the actual frequency of the oscillators at all times. The oscillators will deviate from this natural frequency due to the coupling with all other oscillators, governed by a coupling term $K$. This may be a constant, resulting in uniform all-to-all coupling, but we allow it to be an NxN adjacency matrix such that the oscillators can be coupled in a variety of manners, e.g. uniform, non-uniform, local, unidirectional, self-coupled etc. In the typical all-to-all setup with no self-coupling is a symmetrix matrix with all diagonal elements set to 0. This coupling gives rise to strong synchronization for a certain range of natural frequencies, where the instantaneous frequencies become the same. However, an assumption of the Kuramoto model is weak coupling, and so any synchronization that happens is abrupt and only for a limited range of natural frequencies.

The code provides a struct for the Kuramoto model setup, where you are expected to provide the initial phase (u0), the natural frequencies ($\omega$), the adjacency matrix ($K$), the start and end times (tstart and tend) and the time step (dt, though it may be neglected on running the code as you can select a variable time step solver). Furthermore, for the stochastic Kuramoto model you must explicitly provide a noise strength (D).

It present you with a selection of fuctions, each of which are related to a different methods. The variations are dynamic and static solvers, the latter of which attempts to preallocate the intermediate steps of the solution to minimize the time spent allocating new data. For small problems, ~4 oscillators, this can result in result in the simulation being one order of magnitude faster. For large problems, >100 oscillators, the benefits of a static solver decrease, and it may be better to switch to a dynamic solver. Additionally, you have to manually tell the code to use a stochastic solver, as it will not detect it even if D != 0.

## Examples

We provide several examples for use of the Kuramoto model, located within the 'examples/' folder:

- A simple example covered in 'basic', which simply sets up two oscillators with the same initial phase and a distribution of initial conditions, and runs it for 100 ns. These oscillators synchronize.

- A synchronization map. This is created via a system of 4 oscillators. Two oscillators are designated as 'input' and two as 'output'. The coupling constant is fixed to a certain value. Then, while the natural frequency of the 'output' oscillators is kept constant, the 'input' oscillators have their natural frequencies varied in a given range in a quantized way, one combination of input frequencies at a time. The example then measures the synchronization of the output oscillators as a function of the input natural frequencies. This is called a synchronization map.

- A synchronization map subject to a non-uniform adjacency matrix. This is inspired by the work [Garg et. al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/ac3258/pdf), who in part used the Kuramoto model in the creation of an oscillatory neural network. The parameters closely match theirs, including the weaker coupling between the input-input and output-outout pairs of oscillators. By first running the Julia script to generate the garg.txt output file, it is shown that the output of our Kuramoto model implementation matches that expected by them. It should also be noted that the coupling constants they report are post-normalization, which for our implementation necessitated that the K matrix must be multiplied by N.

- A simple, 2 oscillator stochastic simulation. This is comapred to an equivalent non-stochastic simulation (all parameters are identical, but D = 0) to show the effect of noise on the synchronization.

- A large simulation of 100 oscillators connected all-to-all uniformly, subject to randomized natural frequencies and initial phases.
